        Ingredients:
      <li> 3 scoops of vanilla (or flavor of choice) ice cream </li>
      <li> 2 oz (60 ml) milk </li>
      <li> Chocolate, strawberry, or caramel syrup (optional) </li>
      <li> Vanilla extract (optional) </li>
      <li>  Malt powder (optional) </li>

      <li> 3 crumbled cookies (optional) </li>
      <li> 1 candy bar, chopped into small pieces (optional) </li>
      <br>
        <strong> How to make it: </strong><br>
        <p>Let your ice cream soften to the consistency of soft-serve. The ideal temperature for milkshake-ready ice cream is 20°F (-7°C) and your freezer will probably keep it at about 0°F (-18°C). Allow the ice cream to sit out on the counter for a few minutes to soften.
        Add three scoops of ice cream to your blender or milkshake mixer. A milkshake mixer is best because it churns and aerates your milkshake at the same time. But if you're not ready to invest in professional equipment, a regular kitchen blender or immersion (stick) blender will work fine.
        If you don't have any of those things, use a large bowl and a whisk to beat the ice cream and milk together.
        As you begin the recipe, take the glass you plan to use for your milkshake and put it in the freezer. Then it will be nice and chilled when you're ready to serve.
        Pour in 2 oz (1/4 cup or 60 ml) of milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and any additional ingredients. This is when you can transform your vanilla milkshake into a malt, chocolate shake, strawberry shake, or even a caramel-pretzel-chocolate-chip shake.
        Never add ice to a milkshake. It will water down your shake and dilute the flavor and creaminess.
        Blend your milkshake for about 1 minute. If you are using a blender, don't just turn it on and let it go. Alternate between pulsing the blender and then hand-mixing with a spoon. This will give you the same effect as a spindle milkshake mixer.
        No matter which mixing method you use (whisk, stick blender, professional milkshake blender), you want to make sure your shake remains thick. If you insert a spoon and try to pull it out, the thick shake should give a little resistance.
        If you like a lumpy milkshake, only mix your shake for 30-45 seconds.
        If your shake seems too thick, add a splash of milk.
        If your shake seems too watered down, add another scoop or half-scoop of ice cream and mix.
        Pour the milkshake into your chilled glass. If the milkshake is the right thickness and consistency, you should need to use the spoon to get it out of the blender and into the glass. If it slides out easily, it's too thin or over-mixed and you'll want to add more ice cream.
        Top your milkshake with a healthy squirt of whipped cream and a maraschino cherry Or garnish with a little extra of your chosen ingredients (like a fresh strawberry for your strawberry shake).
        Serve with a spoon and a straw. </p>
